## 1. C++是什么?

C++是一个多功能的编程语言，并且偏向于系统编程，它：

- 比C语言更好
- 支持数据抽象（例如：类class）
- 支持面向对象编程（例如：继承）
- 支持泛型编程（例如：可复用的泛型容器和算法）
- 支持函数式编程（例如：模板元编程、lambda函数、`constexpr`）

C++被ISO标准委员会稳定支持了几十年，并且还拥有一个庞大且活跃的用户社区。您可以阅读[《The C++ Programming Language》](http://stroustrup.com/4th.html)和[《Evolving a language in and for the real world: C++ 1991-2006》](http://stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf)了解更多。

## 37. What should I tell people who complain that the word “FAQ” is misleading, that it emphasizes the questions rather than the answers, and that we should all start using a different acronym?
## 38. How can I help make the C++ FAQ even better??!??
